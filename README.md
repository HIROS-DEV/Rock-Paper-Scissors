# Project Overview

This is the Javascript foundations course in the Odin Project(URL:https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

(The Odin Project is the free course for learning to become a fullstack web developer)

In this lesson, I have to create a simple Rock Paper Scissors games with using Javascript.
In the current stage, the project can use only in the console log and only see simple prompt messages. 

I have to add webpage with using HTML and CSS for this project later. (The Odin Project said...)

# What did I learn through this course

Of course, I got a fundamental knowledge of Javascript like how to use function, what is number?, what is string?, what is object?, what is array?, etc, etc.

This is an indispensable knowledge for Javascript developer.

But, in my opinion, the most important thing that I got though this course is 
"How to solve the problem?" method.

Everyday, programmers always have to solve the problem.
And, the lesson taught the process.

The process is like this.

First, Programmer should grasp "What the problem exactly?"
If programmer does'nt know the problem exactly, programmer can't solve the problem.

Second, Programmer should make a plan. 
In the other words, "How are you going to solve the problem?"

Perhaps, draw a sketch is useful for creating UI.
Think about input variables and output variables.
"What inputs will your program have?" or "Whatâ€™s the desired output?"

"Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?"

This is algorithm!!

Algorithm as a recipe for solving a particular problem. It defines the steps that need to be taken by the computer to solve a problem in pseudocode.

Third, Programmer should write Pseudocode before write programming code.
Pseudocode should write with plain and easy English.
If you can write the Pseudocode, I think you already finished the almost project.

Finally, we write the programming code.
Big problem later, simple problem earlier.

## Summary

Probably, many students in The Odin Project does not use "How to solve the problem?" method and just google it for solving the course.

Perhaps, they just watched youtube video and "OK!! I created the game!!", and proceed the course. In fact, I did same thing in the past.

But, this time, I didn't.

I used  "How to solve the problem?" method.
I made a plan, write a Pseudocode, and write a Javascript code by myself.

Of course, sometimes, I used google.
But it was not for big problem (For example, search for how to create Rock Paper Scissors game in Javascript. This is the worst search method, and it is useless for programmer even if you finish the project. I learned from my past experience), it was just for small problem.

Thank you for reading.
And, happy coding!!!
