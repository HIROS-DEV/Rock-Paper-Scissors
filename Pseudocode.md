Pseudocode(Project Overview) - This is a simple Pseudocode for this project

1.Rock Paper Scissors

create string variables playerSelection
create string variables computerSelection
ask the user "playerSelection: Rock or Paper or Scissors" and put answer in playerSelection

If user's input do not equal "Rock" or "Paper" or "Scissors", this is error. So, show prompt message again.

playerSelection must be case-incentive.
put the computer's answer in computerSelection automatically.

In this project, we use getComputerChoice function. So create it!!
compare with playerSelection and computerSelection.
In this project, we use playRound function(playRound function takes two parameters(playerSelection, computerSelection)).
So create it!!
This is not a single round game. Multiple rounds game. We should create round function for multiple games.
Create game function and call the playRound function inside it. game function should use loops (for or while)
must be keep score(s) and report winner (create scores variable, and show message)
If game ends, once more function and reset previous all data.
